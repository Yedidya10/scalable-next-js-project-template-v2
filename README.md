### Prettier

[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) is a code formatting tool that helps maintain consistent and visually appealing code styles across your project. It automatically formats your code based on a set of predefined rules, ensuring that the codebase remains neat and readable.

### Husky

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is a Git hook manager that automates tasks before or after specific Git events. In this template, Husky is used to enforce code quality and standards by running linting and formatting checks before committing your code. It ensures a consistent codebase and prevents committing code that doesn't meet project guidelines. This template uses the most recent stable version of Husky.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, you have two options:

### Option 1: Create a Repo on GitHub

1. Click on the `Use this template` green button at the top page.
2. Click on `Create a new repository`.

### Option 2: Download the Repo

1. Download this repository to your local machine by clicking on the "Download" button or using the Git clone command.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file (if applicable) and navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.

After setting up the repository, follow these steps to initialize and run your Next.js application:

1. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Prepare the project by running the following command:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

3. Create an environment file (.env) in the root of your project and populate it with the necessary configuration values:

```bash
# ENV
NODE_ENV=development

# NEXT_AUTH
NEXT_AUTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
NEXT_AUT_SECRET=<secret_token>

# MONGODB
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster.code>.mongodb.net/
MONGODB_URI_LOCALE=mongodb://localhost:27017/<database_name>

# GOOGLE AUTH
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>
```

Make sure to keep this file secure and not commit it to version control.

4. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch your Next.js application and make it accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

You are now ready to start developing your full stack Next.js application! Customize and expand upon the provided template to suit your project's requirements. Happy coding!
